## 自动摘要

arXiv:2607.05805v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dilution refrigerators are the enabling infrastructure of superconducting quantum computers, yet their fault diagnosis is still dominated by threshold alarms that report that something is wrong, not what. We present Onnes, a physics-grounded digital-twin simulator of a dilution refrigerator (a forward physics model with a learned real-fridge noise fingerprint) that drives a live multi-agent LLM operations layer, and use it for a controlled head-to-head between a zero-shot LLM agent panel and a supervised ML classifier on cryogenic fault diagnosis. The twin couples a real dilution-cooling floor, a noise-and-correlation fingerprint learned from real BlueFors logs, and six physics-grounded fault classes, three engineered to overlap on temperature but separate on flow and pressure. Across a 1000-turn evaluation the zero-shot panel shows no significant difference from the classifier on detection but trails on classification, its errors concentrating on the confusable faults. Curated contrastive few-shot demonstrations and self-consistency voting then raise classification accuracy from 0.685 to 0.990, matching the supervised classifier (0.9
